Use Model3DTexture on all flat model renderers (scaled to still appear 0 thick)
Fix Wroughtnaut glitch after explosion
Fix foliaath behavior with multiple players
Wroughtnaut not affected by doMobLoot
Make mobs permanently inactive in peaceful mode
Make MMEntityBase into an interface
Remove animation ID enums and make them per-mob
Balancing - Wroughtnaut too hard? Not worth reward?
